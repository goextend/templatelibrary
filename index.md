Welcome to the Extend Integration Library. This is a set of examples that demonstrate how to integrate various third party APIs into your extensions. For each example we provide information on how to setup your keys (and what limitations may be involved for trials) and provide a sample extension. If you have any suggestions for integrations to add, drop us a [line]() and we'll get back to you!
